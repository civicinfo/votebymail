### Vote absentee or by mail in 2020

This is a state-by-state breakdown of how to request and return an absentee/mail-in ballot for the 2020 US general election to be held on Nov 3, 2020. 


This hobby project was born one weekend out of curiosity to understand how absentee/mail-in voting works in different states. I decided to make the results of my research available in case it is useful to others.


The following information is included for each state as available:
* Absentee/Mail-in eligibility requirements
* How to apply for absentee/mail-in ballot
* Absentee/mail-in application receipt deadline
* Absentee/mail-in ballot requirements
* How to return absentee/mail-in ballot
* Ballot return deadline
* Ballot drop box locations
* Links to official sources


Details will be updated here as they become available.
